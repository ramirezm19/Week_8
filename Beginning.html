                 <h2> How It All Started</h2>

                    <p> In September 2010, I found myself working at a local nonprofit organization. My office mate, Dennis and I, would sometimes have down time between our classes, so we found various ways to keep us entertained. We tended to look out the window of our office often to see what was going outside.<br>
                    <br>        
                    One day, while looking out the window, we noticed a family of squirrels that would go up and down the tree immediately outside of our window.
